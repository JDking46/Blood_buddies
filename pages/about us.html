        Blood bank is a place where blood bag that is collected from blood
        donation events is stored in one place. The term “blood bank” refers to
        a division of a hospital laboratory where the storage of blood product
        occurs and where proper testing is performed to reduce the risk of
        transfusion related events. The process of managing the blood bag that
        is received from the blood donation events needs a proper and systematic
        management. The blood bag must be handled with care and treated
        thoroughly as it is related to someone’s life. The development of
        Web-based Blood Bank And Donation Management System (BBDMS) is proposed
        to provide a management functional to the blood bank in order to handle
        the blood bag and to make entries of the individuals who want to donate
        blood and who are in need.
