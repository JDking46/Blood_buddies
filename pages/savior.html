        The human body contains five liters of blood, which is made of several
        useful components i.e. <strong>Whole blood</strong>,
        <strong>Platelet</strong>, and <strong>Plasma</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each type of component has several medical uses and can be used for
        different medical treatments. Your blood donation determines the best
        donation for you to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <strong>plasma</strong> and <strong>platelet</strong> donation you
        must have donated whole blood in past two years.
